Game Rules

(V1)
- There are 2 players.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as she wishes. These dice rolls add up under CURRENT score.
- However, if a player rolls a 1, her CURRENT score drops back to 0, and it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to HOLD, which means the CURRENT score gets added to the overall PLAYER score.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins!

(V2 - Current)
- Players can now set a custom winning score.
- There are two dice.
- Like before, if one of the dice is a 1, the player's CURRENT score drops back to 0.
- However, if the sum of a player's roll is 6 and this happens twice in a row, she loses her overall PLAYER score. RIP
